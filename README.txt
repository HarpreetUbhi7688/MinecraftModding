## Project Description:

- This project is experimental and test based in the sense that
    I will be using this to learn how to mod everything in the game MineCraft.

- The version of Minecraft used will be the same as the Forge Version, 1.16.5.

- I will be following the videos from this YouTube playlist to learn:

## Personal Notes:

- Feel free to provide any feedback, and I'll try to look at it whenever I can.

- My updates for everything will be based on my own time and basically random.

- This is a personal project and as such there are no limitations or restrictions.

- I'm pretty new to coding and might make mistakes, if you notice them, feel free to correct me.
